# Monea Labs

Monea is an open Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform designed to offer ultimate flexibility for cross-chain app developers and chain operator teams. With the Monea Engine, you can easily experiment with every possible stack, enabling the creation of tailored solutions that fit you and your users' unique needs. We call this concept "rollup legos," allowing you to build and innovate modularly without restrictions.
